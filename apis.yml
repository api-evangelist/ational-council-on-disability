  The National Council on Disability (NCD) is an independent federal agency that
  advises the President, Congress, and other federal agencies on disability
  policy and programs. The NCD works to promote equal opportunity, economic
  self-sufficiency, independent living, and full participation in all areas of
  society for individuals with disabilities. They conduct research, gather
  information, and provide recommendations to improve policies, programs, and
  services that impact people with disabilities. The NCD also works to raise
  awareness and educate the public about disability issues and advocate for the
  rights and inclusion of individuals with disabilities in society.
